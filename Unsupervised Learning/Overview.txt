The following topics are covered:

#1 Overview of unsupervised learning algorithms in Scikit-learn 
#2 Clustering algorithms: K Means, DBScan, Hierarchical Clustering etc,
#3 Dimensionality reduction (PCA) and manifold learning (t-SNE)

# Introduction to Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised machine learning refers to the category of machine learning techniques
where models are trained on a dataset without labels. Unsupervised learning is generally
use to discover patterns in data and reduce high-dimensional data to fewer dimensions.
