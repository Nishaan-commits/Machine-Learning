How to Approach a MAchine Learning Problem

1. Explore the data and find correlations between inputs and targets
2. Pick the right model, loss functions and optimizer for the problem at hand
3. Scale numeric variables and one-hot encode categorical data
4. Set aside a test set (using a fraction of the training set)
5. Train the model
6. Make the predictions on the test set and compute the loss
